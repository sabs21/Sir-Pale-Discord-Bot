# Sir-Pale-Discord-Bot
My personal sandbox bot.

-- 2019 UPDATE --
I've uploaded all of the updates that I have done over the past 3 years. This bot now has much more functionality, including:
- Emoji store, where you can collect and buy emojis using the bot's currency system
- Slots, where you can gamble to your heart's content.
- Dictionary, where you can finally figure out what Hullaballoo really means.
- Random Imgur and ifunny Image fetcher, for when you feel like exploring the wide world of imgur or ifunny.

-- Installation --
You'll need to download and install Discord.js 11.3, Node.js 8.9.4, Express 4.x, Cheerio (latest version works, type ```npm install cheerio```), and Request 2.88
